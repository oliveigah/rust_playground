# 1. Getting started

- Rust comes with rustc that can be used to compile simple programs
- It produces an executable that can be executed even without rust
- Despite that, rustc is almost never used directly, instead use Cargo
- Cargo is a build system and package manager that provides all you need to work with rust
- To create a new project: `cargo new $PROJECT_NAME`
- It already creates some files and structure to your code such as src folder and Cargo.toml
- Cargo.toml is where you define dependencies and all your projects metadata
- To build a project: `cargo build` (produces executables into target folder)
- To run (compile and execute) a project: `cargo run`
- To check if compile: `cargo check` (faster than compile)
- Cargo build has 2 default profiles one for dev (with no optmizations) and other for production
- When build for prod or to benchmark always use `cargo build --release`
