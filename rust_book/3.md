# 3. Common Programming Concepts

## 3.1 - Variables

- Variables are immutable by default they can be made mutable by using the `mut` keyword
- Constants are like immutable variables but it's value must be known at compile time and can be declared at any scope (including global)
- You can rebound variable values (even immutable ones) by redeclaring it, this process is called shadowing
- Shadowing is bounded by scope, so inner scopes can shadow variables only inside it
- Shadowing is different from `mut` because it creates a new variable from scratch, you can even give it a different type

## 3.2 - Data Types

- Every value in rust MUST be of exclusively one type, and it's type must be deterministic at compile time
- Some functions such as `parse` from String, infer the type to parse to from type annotation
- There are 2 types of types, scalar and compound
- Scalar types represents a single value
- Compound types can group multiple values
- Scalar types are:
  - integer, that can vary by length and signed x unsigned
  - floating, that can vary by length
  - boolean
  - character, 4 bytes that represents unicode
- Compound types are:
  - tuple, hold values of diferent types and has fixed length
  - array, hold values of the same type and has fixed length
- Integers may overflow, and there are some specific functions to handle that properly such as `wrapping_add`
- Basic numeric operations will keep the type of it's parts and all parts must have the same type
- You can match on tuples values and also destructuring it on the match
- An empty tuple is a `unit` and it represents an empty value, all expressions return `unit` if they do not return some value specifically

## 3.3 - Functions

- The main function is the entry point for the majority of programs
- Each function parameter must be of one specific type
- Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an expression
- Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value
- Expressions evaluate to a resultant value
- You can evaluate entire scopes by using `{ block_of_code }` ending the block with an expression
- Expressions do not end with `;` if you add it it turns to a statement
- Functions may have return values, the return value type must be known at compile time
- The value of the last expression of a function is it's return value
- The keyword `return` might be used in order to do early returns

## 3.5 - Control Flow

- `if` is composed by the condition and the expressions blocks
- the `if` conditition must be a boolean
- `if` it self is an expression, so it evaluates to the resulting value of one of its expressions block
- Since `if` is a expression, you can use it on assignments and on other `else` blocks
- When using `if` on assigments both blocks must evaluate to the same type known at compiletime
- To repeat some code you have 3 basic constructs:
  - `loop`: Iterates until explicitly break or return
  - `while`: Iterates while a conditition is passing
  - `for`: Iterates through items of a given collection
- `break` and `continue` might be used to break early or skip to the next of any construct
- Any loop construct is an expression and therefore may return a value
- You can have nested loops and `break` or `continue` an specific one using loop labels. eg: `'my_loop1: loop {}`
