# 2. Guessing game

- Some subset of the std library is automtically imported, the imported items belongs to the prelude
- If something is not on the prelude you must import it normally such as: `use std::io`
- `let` is the keyword for declaring variables, immutable by default
- `mut` is the keyword to make variables mutable
- `=` signs bind the variable to a value, immutable variables can not be bind to new values
- `::` indicates that a functions is associated with a certaing type. eg: `String::new`
- `::` is also used as namespace sparators as in `std::io::stdin`
- `.` is used to call methods associated with a given instance of a type as in `::io.stdin().read_line` or `10.cmp(&5);`
- `&` creates a reference, references enable data sharing with zero copy and many functions work with references
- References (`&`) are also immutable by default and can be mutable by using `mut`
- `Enumeration` or `enum` is a type that can have multiple state
- Each enum state is a `variant`
- One of the most used enums is `Result` that wraps operations results and have 2 variants ok and err
- `Result` is kind of a monad, more similar to ok error tuples in erlang/elixir
- `Result` is implemented as a generic and all concrete implementations are defined in compile time
- The generated binary will contain multiple versions of result, one for each type it can hold on your program
- `Result` also have a bunch of associated methods, such as `expect` that make easy to work with it
- A lot of functions and methods return the `Result` type for error handling purposes
- Dependencies use SemVer and are managed inside Cargo.toml
- By default Cargo only updates patch versions, so major and minor are not updated automatically on `cargo update`
- Cargo generates Cargo.lock with a locked version of dependencies, `cargo update` updates it
- Cargo automatically get all dependencies and dependencies of the dependencies and so on
- Crates obtained through Cargo can be used normally as in `use rand::Rng`
- Crates have their on documentation that can be downloaded locally by using `cargo doc`
- `Ordering` is a enum with 3 variantes `Less`, `Greater` and `Equal`
- `cmp` is a method implemented by multiple types that is used to compare 2 values and return `Ordering`
- You can `match` on arbitrary values in order to decide code execution flow, very similar to elixir
- Rust has type inferences, so it will infer variable types based on the context
- Rust allow mutable variable rebinding to new values, even chaning types in the process
